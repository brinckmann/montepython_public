Hillipop is a high-l polarized likelihood for Planck PR4 data. 

Hillipop is a multifrequency CMB likelihood for Planck data. The
likelihood is a spectrum-based Gaussian approximation for
cross-correlation spectra from Planck 100, 143 and 217GHz
split-frequency maps, with semi-analytic estimates of the Cl
covariance matrix based on the data. The cross-spectra are debiased
from the effects of the mask and the beam leakage using Xpol (a
generalization to polarization of the algorithm presented in Tristram
et al. 2005) before being compared to the model, which includes CMB
and foreground residuals. They cover the multipoles from ~=30 to ~=2500.

The code is available here:

This is a wrapper for MontePython.

You need to install the code before:
> pip install planck-2020-hillipop

Then get the data, untar and set the variable $COBAYA_PACKAGES_PATH to the local directory:
> wget https://portal.nersc.gov/cfs/cmb/planck2020/likelihoods/planck_2020_hillipop_TT_v4.2.tar.gz
> tar -zxvf planck_2020_hillipop_TT_v4.2.tar.gz --directory /path/to/data
> export COBAYA_PACKAGES_PATH=/path/to/data
